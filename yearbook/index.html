                <h2>Riley Schmitz</h2>
                <h3>BASKET CASE</h3>
                <p>Riley is a highly professional individual. She is insane for the most part but very excited about what the future holds. She created this website mostly to tell her friends she appreciates them. (Also because she wants an A (please))</p>

                <h2>Stephen Peasley</h2>
                <h3>AS SEEN ON NETFLIX</h3>
                <p>Stephen is multi talented, with experience as an actor, web developer, and cool UX guy. He's pretty neat. Riley is going to miss having him as an instructor.</p>

                <h2>Zaki Castillo</h2>
                <h3>PRO SCOOPER</h3>
                <p>Zaki is a fashion icon first and foremost. He is also an extremely talented designer. Zaki is one of the kindest souls that Riley has ever met, and she believes that he deserves the entire world.</p>

                <h2>Khoi Nguyen</h2>
                <h3>MURDEROUS TENDENCIES</h3>
                <p>Khoi is Riley's emotional support dog. He is also very open about the fact that he has dreams about killing his friends. They all think he should get that checked out. Riley would not have made it through November without Khoi and she is so grateful for him and doesn't say it often enough.</p>

                <h2>Jason Ye</h2>
                <h3>PRO SLEEPER</h3>
                <p>Jason is always sleeping. He occasionally snores. During his short-lived periods of physical awareness, he says silly things and then apologizes for saying them out loud. Riley thinks he should stop apologizing because we love him regarless.</p>

                <h2>Ronald Atutubo</h2>
                <h3>HE LIKES SPORTS</h3>
                <p>Ronald is a cool guy all around. He is very chill and a talented designer. He almost got tricked into going on a tinder date with a dude once but ran for the hills because he doesn't swing that way. Riley thinks Ron is really cool and she looks up to him (literally and figuratively).</p>

                <h2>Tina Le</h2>
                <h3>SCHOOL MOM</h3>
                <p>Tina is really cool and too kind for this world. She taught Riley that transit costs were included in her tuition. This was life changing. She is also extremely intelligent and knows the answer to everything (seriously.)</p>
            </div>

                <h2>Brianna Truong</h2>
                <h3>PROFESSIONAL AARON HATER</h3>
                <p>Brianna is very funny. She is also very intelligent, and (in her own mind) is always right. She is also far too kind for this world, and she may be unaware of the fact that every time she tells Riley that her outfit "slays," it makes her whole day.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="team-member">

                <h2>Aaron Nicor</h2>
                <h3>NUT ALLERGY</h3>
                <p>Aaron can't handle nuts. The student body is planning to gang up on him and stone him to death using cashews. He should run as he is in danger. He is also under the impression that he is funny? Riley doesn't understand why he thinks this of himself.</p>
            </div>

                <img src="../images/chris.png" alt="Team Member 2">
                <h2>Chris Nicdao</h2>
                <h3>MAKES COOL RUGS</h3>
                <p>Chris is a cool guy, and always very helpful. He is a good conversationalist and also is very funny. If RIley's memory does not decieve her, he believes in Apple Care, and loses points for that because Apple Care is a scam. Overall, Chris is a very good role model for Riley and she thinks he is awesome.</p>

                <img src="../images/jessa.png" alt="Team Member 2">
                <h2>Jessabelle Lau Suba</h2>
                <h3>PRO STREAMERRR</h3>
                <p>Jessabelle is so damn cool. Riley's first impression of her was first semester during the design portfolio presentations. She had made Sanrio BMO thingies for discord and Riley thought it was the dopest thing she had ever seen.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="team-member">
                <img src="../images/jin.png" alt="Team Member 2">
                <h2>Jin Kim</h2>
                <h3>NEVER IN CLASS</h3>
                <p>Jin is an illusive creature. Riley didn't know who he was until halfway into the semester because she is unobservant and he was never in class. He is very cool though. Hales from Regina.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="team-member">
                <img src="../images/talson.png" alt="Team Member 2">
                <h2>Talson Neufeld</h2>
                <h3>THE WEB GUY</h3>
                <p>Talson is dope as hell specifically due to his supreme proficiency in Web. Riley does not know much about Talson aside from that, but she looks forward to getting to know him better. After he no longer had to be suspicious about how I was goint to use the image that I requested, he sent me this one. It slays.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="team-member">

                <h2>Paige Stacey</h2>
                <h3>P.I.P (PARTNER IN PIMPING)</h3>
                <p>Paige is a very skilled Graphic Designer, and she is also very funny. Paige and Riley are going to band together and pimp out Khoi, Jason, Zaki, and Aleks. The girls will keep all the profit for themselves.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="team-member">
                <img src="../images/kayla.png" alt="Team Member 2">
                <h2>Kayla Nikpour</h2>
                <h3>ACADEMIC WEAPON</h3>
                <p>Kayla's favourite word is "Euphoria" and its so cute because it suits her so well. She also knows everything about everything. Riley misses Kayla because they never see eachother anymore. Kayla recently got promoted at work and Riley is so proud of her.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="team-member">
                <img src="../images/olivia.png" alt="Team Member 2">
                <h2>Olivia Baychu</h2>
                <h3>PRO HATER (GENERAL)</h3>
                <p>Olivia has her shit together and her priorities straight and it's very iconic of her. She is also very funny, and dances like a milennial. Riley thinks Olivia is so awesome and wants to go to a rave with her.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="team-member">
                <img src="../images/nico.png" alt="Team Member 2">
                <h2>Nico Jaramillo</h2>
                <h3>DELUSIONAL</h3>
                <p>Nico is a professional at handing his assignments in 3-5 business days after the deadline. Nico was Riley's first friend at SAIT. He not only puts up with, but ENCOURAGES her absolutely insane ideas. The two of them are delusional together. She appreciates him more than he will ever know.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="team-member">
                <img src="../images/elijah.png" alt="Team Member 2">
                <h2>Elijah Temple</h2>
                <h3>NEEDS NICO TO STOP BEING DELUSIONAL</h3>
                <p>Eliajh is a sweeheart, he is also amazing at making people laugh. He is also very good at knocking some sense into people. Elijah is great to work on group projects with and Riley can't wait to see where his life goes because he is going to do amazing things.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="team-member">
                <img src="../images/aleks.png" alt="Team Member 2">
                <h2>Aleks Chervyakov</h2>
                <h3>COMPLETE MYSTERY</h3>
                <p>Aleks is not good at sharing in groups (that's not diss, he said so himself.) So far, Riley knows that he's Russian, he's from Toronto, and he lived in Georgia for a bit. He was also a professional gamer. Apparently "you should just be able to google [him]" to find out more.</p>
